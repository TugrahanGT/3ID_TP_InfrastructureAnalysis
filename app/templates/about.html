                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                  Triple-ID was born as the paths of experienced IAM Consultants crossed and they decided to combine their forces to create the perfect Identity and Access Management consulting company. Each of the initial team members has extensive knowledge on multiple IAM Products including Omada Identity, Oracle Identity Manager, OneIdentity, and SailPoint.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They worked in projects across Europe with customers from diverse industries like finance, automotive, healthcare, and government institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Last but not least, we have also been there, where you as a customer are now, responsible for the integration and maintenance of a product touching almost every system of your company infrastructure.
