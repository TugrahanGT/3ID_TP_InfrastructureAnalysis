                <h2>What is NIST?</h2>
                <p>
                    The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides frameworks, guidelines, and best practices that help organizations manage cybersecurity risks. NIST's cybersecurity frameworks are voluntary guidance based on existing standards, guidelines, and practices for organizations to better manage and reduce cybersecurity risks.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Key Publications:</strong></p>
                <ul>

                <ul class="nist-list">
                    <li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Users should only be granted access to the specific resources they need to perform their jobs</li>
                    <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control:</strong> Access decisions based on users' roles within an organization</li>
                    <li><strong>Separation of Duties:</strong> Critical tasks should be divided among multiple individuals</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Review:</strong> Access rights should be regularly reviewed and revoked when no longer needed</li>

                <p>The framework consists of five core functions:</p>

                    <li><strong>Identify:</strong> Develop an understanding of systems, assets, data, and capabilities</li>
                    <li><strong>Protect:</strong> Implement safeguards to ensure delivery of critical services</li>
                    <li><strong>Detect:</strong> Develop activities to identify cybersecurity events</li>
                    <li><strong>Respond:</strong> Develop techniques to contain impacts of cybersecurity events</li>
                    <li><strong>Recover:</strong> Develop strategies to restore capabilities impaired by cybersecurity events</li>
